sshfu: ssh config manager
-------------------------

This is an early early POC, both as in proof of concept, and
as in piece of crap. Be foolish at you own peril.

You can manage you ˜/.ssh/config through ˜/.ssh/sshfu/routes

When you run sshfu, it will open $EDITOR on ˜/.ssh/sshfu/routes
and fire up the compilation when you quit.

This program uses the highly advanced garbage-in garbage-out
error protection mechanism.

ssh_config.tail and ssh_config.head will be appendend at
the obvious places of the generated configuration.

The point of this is to have a slightly shorter syntax
so you can have a better picture of what you are doing.

Example:
host server address server.test user root
host grimalkin address 192.168.1.1 gw server user cmad
host vm1 address 10.10.1.1 gw grimalkin
