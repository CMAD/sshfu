sshfu: ~/.ssh/config manager.

This script provides an alternative line-by-line syntax
for ~/.ssh/config that is a little easier on the eyes.

When you have more than two hosts on you configuration it
get's a litte verbose for simple things, and here is where
this syntax helps.

sshfu will fire $EDITOR on ~/.ssh/sshfu/routes and when
you exit, compile the resulting configuration along with
~/.ssh/sshfu/ssh_config.head and ~/.ssh/sshfu/ssh_config.tail 
into you actual ~/.ssh/config.

To make things easier, the first time you run it, it will
try to copy itself to /usr/local/bin to be on you path.

Also, if you are running it from the uncompressed archive
it will install a vim syntax highliting file, and set it up.

If an allready existing ~/.ssh/config exits, it will make a
copy on ~/.ssh/original_ssh_config, and try to import you
configuration.

It has no options, the only thing you need to do to use it
is fire sshfu. There are commented examples on the 
configuration file that will show up when you run it.

here is what the syntax looks like:

host server address server.test user root
host grimalkin address 192.168.1.1 gw server user cmad
host vm1 address 10.10.1.1 gw grimalkin

It shouldn't do any harm to say but, this script is 
garbage-in garbage-out, which means, if yo put a typo
in the sshfu config file, expect one in your ~/.ssh/config
