{"name":"Sshfu","body":"# sshfu: ~/.ssh/config manager.\r\n\r\nThis script provides an alternative line-by-line syntax\r\nfor ~/.ssh/config that is a little easier on the eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen you have more than two hosts on you configuration it\r\ngets a little verbose for simple things, and here is where\r\nthis syntax helps.\r\n\r\nHere is what the syntax looks like:\r\n\r\n````shell\r\nhost server address server.test user root\r\nhost grimalkin address 192.168.1.1 gw server user cmad\r\nhost vm1 address 10.10.1.1 gw grimalkin\r\n````\r\n\r\nAnd this what it will compile into:\r\n\r\n````shell\r\nHost server\r\n  HostName server.test\r\n  User root\r\n\r\nHost grimalkin\r\n  HostName 192.168.1.1\r\n  ProxyCommand ssh server -W %h:%p\r\n  User cmad\r\n\r\nHost vm1 \r\n  HostName 10.10.1.1\r\n  ProxyCommand ssh grimalkin -W %h:%p\r\n````\r\n\r\nIf it finds an already existing ~/.ssh/config, it will\r\nmake a copy on ~/.ssh/original_ssh_config, and try to import \r\nyou configuration.\r\n\r\nAlso to make things easier, the first time you run it, it will\r\ntry to copy itself to /usr/local/bin to be on you path.\r\n\r\nAnd if you are running it from the uncompressed archive\r\nit will install a vim syntax highlighting file, and set it up.\r\n\r\nIt has no options, the only thing you need to do to use it\r\nis to fire it, $ sshfu. There are commented examples on the \r\nconfiguration file that will show up when you run it.\r\n\r\nsshfu will fire $EDITOR on ~/.ssh/sshfu/routes and when\r\nyou exit, compile the resulting configuration along with\r\n~/.ssh/sshfu/ssh_config.head and ~/.ssh/sshfu/ssh_config.tail \r\ninto you actual ~/.ssh/config.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't do any harm to say but, this script is \r\ngarbage-in garbage-out, which means, if yo put a typo\r\nin the sshfu config file, expect one in your ~/.ssh/config\r\n\r\nMaybe latter I will provide some options, like re-import\r\nfrom ~/.ssh/config, make it more clean, etc. For the time\r\nbeing, it's just something I use, and hopefully it maybe\r\nof some use to you.\r\n\r\nFor how it works, it's just a bunch of sed, and some \r\nm4, does the job, but don't press it too much.\r\n\r\nBye.\r\n","tagline":"~./ssh/config manager","google":"UA-32716828-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
