{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"sshfu: ~/.ssh/config manager.\r\n\r\nThis script provides an alternative line-by-line syntax for ~/.ssh/config that is a little easier on the eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen you have more than two hosts on you configuration it gets a little verbose for simple things, and here is where this syntax helps.\r\n\r\nThis is what the syntax looks like:\r\n\r\n````shell\r\nhost server address server.test user root\r\nhost grimalkin address 192.168.1.1 gw server user cmad\r\nhost vm1 address 10.10.1.1 gw grimalkin\r\n````\r\n\r\nAnd this what it will compile into:\r\n\r\n````shell\r\nHost server\r\n  HostName server.test\r\n  User root\r\n\r\nHost grimalkin\r\n  HostName 192.168.1.1\r\n  ProxyCommand ssh server -W %h:%p\r\n  User cmad\r\n\r\nHost vm1 \r\n  HostName 10.10.1.1\r\n  ProxyCommand ssh grimalkin -W %h:%p\r\n````\r\n\r\nIf it finds an already existing ~/.ssh/config, it will make a copy on ~/.ssh/original_ssh_config, and try to import your configuration.\r\n\r\nsshfu will fire $EDITOR on ~/.ssh/sshfu/routes and when you exit, compile the resulting configuration along with ~/.ssh/sshfu/ssh_config.head and ~/.ssh/sshfu/ssh_config.tail into your actual ~/.ssh/config.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't do any harm to say but, this script is garbage-in garbage-out, which means, if yo put a typo in the sshfu config file, expect one in your ~/.ssh/config\r\n\r\nMaybe latter I will provide some options, like re-import from ~/.ssh/config, make it more clean, etc. For the time being, it's just something I use, and hopefully it maybe of some use to you.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Some of us are actually using it at work, and now is a tcl script, also we are using it to dinamically\r\nchoose gateway if for example we are at home and need to reach a server. It can also detect cycles.\r\n\r\nBye.\r\n","name":"Sshfu","tagline":"~./ssh/config manager","google":"UA-32716828-1"}
